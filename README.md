# Python_Web_Scraping_Organization_Application_Filter
This project is developed as there is a lack of search and sort function UUM's organization list for job application. Therefore we developed this system to scrap the data and create our own database with those features included. However, due to organization private information privacy we did not disclose the data to public. We used Python together with BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium WebDriver libraries. BeautifulSoup4 was used to scrap the data meanwhile Selenium were used for webpage navigation. The system has 2 phases where scraping is first phase meanwhile a web application with database is the second phase. The second phase is complete but ended due to privacy concerned and time limitation. For the first phase there is some navigation elements left to complete automate the system. Therefore there will be further development to the system after we are free.
